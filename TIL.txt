Today I learned about bitcoin. The reason many people talk about and want to use bitcoin is because it is a p2p network. Right now we can see many instances of websites being hacked or websites being hacked which leads to massive damage for many users. To prevent this type of instance Satoshi suggested a p2p network for sending electronic money. However the current problem is that it takes a lot of time for transactions to be approved, which limits its practicality. To solve this problem a few suggestions have been made. For example proof of stake has been suggested as a way since it drastically reduces the amount of time needed to reach finality. Another method suggested is using deposit. If the block you approved is wrong, the deposit will automatically be subtracted from your account balance, it makes sure that people will be honest when voting for blocks.
